## Dashboard Page
The dashboard page offers a high-level overview of the application and analysis of uploaded

## Upload File Page
This page enables you to upload both structured and unstructured data for parsing. The system
automatically identifies and maps key fields such as the message title, sender, timestamp, and body.
Should the automatic mapping not align perfectly, you're provided the option to manually remap these
fields to ensure accuracy. For unstructured data, the system uses OpenAI's capabilities for
efficient formatting.

insights. Leverage data refined by OpenAI, or utilise the in-line analysis from the NLP for nuanced
understanding. For interactive analysis, engage with the system through the chatbox located at the
bottom-right corner of your screen. Additionally, manage your uploads via the 'My Documents' side
panel, which displays all files you've uploaded, allowing for simple file deletion and organisation.
