On 2021-09-25T15:30:01, Jamie Smith said "Yo, fellas, has anyone heard from Erin today? 🤔 Was supposed to meet her at the library today but she didn't show"
On 2021-09-25T15:32:15, Alex Martinez said "Nah bro, haven't heard from her since yesterday. She said something 'bout going to that new exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Maybe she got caught up there? 🎨"
On 2021-09-25T15:34:50, Mia Williams said "Guuuys, I'm getting worried now 😟 We should've heard from her by now. She ain't the type to just vanish like this."
On 2021-09-25T15:36:30, Jamie Smith said "True that, Mia. Let's not freak out though. Lemme try calling her again"
On 2021-09-25T15:38:10, Alex Martinez said "While you're at it, Jamie, someone should reach out to her folks too. They might know something"
On 2021-09-25T15:40:20, Mia Williams said "Good call, Alex. I'll hit up Mrs. Johnson. She's always been chill with us. 📲"
On 2021-09-25T15:43:45, Jamie Smith said "Still no answer guys. Her phone is going straight to voicemail. 😓"
On 2021-09-25T15:46:00, Alex Martinez said "Yo, what if she's in some kinda trouble? Like, should we call the cops or sumthin'?"
On 2021-09-25T15:47:30, Mia Williams said "Hold up, Alex. Just talked to Erin's mom. She said Erin mentioned something about going to a book signing at Barnes & Noble this afternoon. 📖 Might be J.K. Rowling's new book or something."
On 2021-09-25T15:50:00, Jamie Smith said "Ahh, that makes sense. Erin's a huge Harry Potter fan. ⚡️ Let's chill for a bit. Maybe she's just lost track of time, y'know how she gets around books."
On 2021-09-25T16:10:20, Mia Williams said "Guys, I just talked to the staff at Barnes & Noble. They said the book signing ended an hour ago and Erin wasn't there. 😱"
On 2021-09-25T16:12:35, Jamie Smith said "Wait, what?! 😟 But if she wasn't at the museum or the book signing, where could she be?"
On 2021-09-25T16:14:00, Alex Martinez said "This ain't good, y'all. 😓 We gotta do something. Maybe we should really call the cops now."
On 2021-09-25T16:16:45, Mia Williams said "Yeah, I think we should. Erin wouldn't just disappear without telling anyone. 😭"
On 2021-09-25T16:19:30, Jamie Smith said "Alright, I'm gonna call the police. In the meantime, let's keep trying to reach her and check around if anyone has seen her."
On 2021-09-25T16:22:10, Alex Martinez said "I'll head over to the museum again. Maybe someone there saw her"
On 2021-09-25T16:24:20, Mia Williams said "And I'll ask around the neighborhood. Let's hope we find her soon"
On 2021-09-25T16:27:00, Jamie Smith said "Just got off the phone with the police. They're gonna start a search…"
On 2021-09-25T16:35:10, Mia Williams said "Guys... I have to tell you something... I didn't want to scare you before... but I think Erin might have been in some kind of trouble... 😥"
On 2021-09-25T16:37:15, Jamie Smith said "What?! Mia, you gotta spill it now, you can't drop a bomb like that and not explain."
On 2021-09-25T16:39:40, Alex Martinez said "Yeah, Mia! What the heck? We're freaking out here! 😡"
On 2021-09-25T16:41:00, Mia Williams said "Alright, alright! 😓 So, yesterday Erin was telling me about this guy she met online. She said she was going to meet him today..."
On 2021-09-25T16:43:30, Jamie Smith said "Wait, what? Erin was meeting a stranger? And you didn't think to tell us this before?"
On 2021-09-25T16:45:20, Alex Martinez said "Dude, that's not cool. She could be in real danger. We gotta tell the cops this ASAP!"
On 2021-09-25T16:48:00, Mia Williams said "I know, I know! I messed up. I didn't think it would come to this. I'm gonna call the police and tell them about this guy"
