2021-09-24T20:30:01, Erin Johnson: Hey Mia, guess what? I met this really cool guy online. We've been chatting for a while now, he seems pretty chill. ðŸ˜Š
2021-09-24T20:32:15, Mia Williams: Oh, really? That's interesting. What's he like? ðŸ¤”
2021-09-24T20:34:50, Erin Johnson: His name's Danny. He's into art and literature just like me. We've been bonding over J.K. Rowling's books. ðŸ“š He even promised to get me a signed copy of her latest book!
2021-09-24T20:37:30, Mia Williams: Whoa, that's pretty cool! But Erin, you gotta be careful, okay? You never know with people online. ðŸ‘€
2021-09-24T20:40:00, Erin Johnson: I know, Mia. But he doesn't seem like a creep. He works at this tech company, Silicon Valley vibes, you know? He even showed me a pic of him with Elon Musk at a SpaceX event. ðŸš€
2021-09-24T20:43:45, Mia Williams: Woah, sounds impressive. But still, Erin, you gotta be careful. Meeting him in a public place, right?
2021-09-24T20:46:00, Erin Johnson: Yes, mom! ðŸ™„ We're meeting at the Metropolitan Museum of Art tomorrow. I've always wanted to go there, and he's a member. Seems like a safe place.
2021-09-24T20:47:30, Mia Williams: Alright, as long as you're sure. Just keep your phone with you and let me know if anything feels off, okay?
2021-09-24T20:50:00, Erin Johnson: Got it, Mia. Thanks for looking out for me. You're the best.
2021-09-24T20:52:30, Mia Williams: That's what friends are for, Erin. Just stay safe, okay?
