2023-11-01T09:12:32, Jacob: Goodmorning lovely! ðŸ˜Š Can you believe it's been a few months already since we started talking?
2023-11-01T09:13:54, Emily: Time really flies, doesn't it? I've enjoyed every moment of it. ðŸ˜„
2023-11-01T09:14:23, Jacob: Me too! It's been so easy talking to you, like we've known each other forever. I can't wait for the day we finally meet in person.
2023-11-01T09:14:54, Emily: Same here! Any thoughts on when that might be?
2023-11-01T09:15:52, Jacob: Well, I've been thinking about planning a trip to your city next month. What do you think?
2023-11-01T09:15:59, Emily: Seriously? That's amazing! I'd love to meet you. Let's make it happen.
2023-11-01T09:17:32, Jacob: Yay! I'm really looking forward to it. We'll have so much to catch up on, and I'm sure it will be even more fun in person.
2023-11-01T09:18:59, Emily: Definitely! Do you have any particular places you'd like to visit when you're here?
2023-11-01T09:20:12, Jacob: I'm open to suggestions, but I'd love to try some local restaurants and maybe go for a nice walk in the park. What are your favourite spots?
2023-11-01T09:21:23, Emily: There's a great little Italian place near my apartment, 3 Port Dundas Place, and the park down the road is beautiful, especially in the evening. We should definitely check those out. 
2023-11-01T09:21:58, Jacob: Sounds perfect! I can't wait to explore your city with you. Although I wonâ€™t be able to stay for too long, things have gotten worse with Casey again. 
2023-11-01T09:22: 21, Emily: Casey? 
2023-11-01T09:23:02, Jacob: Sorry autocorrect, meant Chris. He has ended up back in jail again and I really donâ€™t have the time, energy, money, or resources to fight for him and help him pay for lawyers.
2023-11-01T09:23:45, Emily: Oh my goodness. Iâ€™m so sorry to hear that Jacob. Are you feeling okay? 
2023-11-01T09:24:18, Jacob: Itâ€™s just very stressful, worrying about how if I help Chris out how I will be able to pay the bills this month. 
2023-11-01T09:26:53, Emily: Jacob, I know I said it was just a one off last month but I can help you out if needed, please just let me know. I just got my bonus last week, so I would be more than happy to help- especially if you are dropping by next month. 
2023-11-01T09:27:32, Jacob: Really? Are you sure? You really donâ€™t have to do this, but it would mean the world to me!
2023-11-01T09:28:20, Emily: No honestly. How much would you need? 
2023-11-01T09:29:27, Jacob: Perhaps $950 would be amazing. I can pay you back when I see you next month, or pay for our dinners and stuff. 
2023-11-01T09:29:51, Emily: No problem, make it $1000. You are such a sweet guy Jacob, you donâ€™t deserve this stress. 
2023-11-01T09:30:20, Jacob: Thank you. I really appreciate it. You are an angel ðŸ¥° canâ€™t wait to meet you
2023-11-01T09:34:21, Emily: Likewise! So, aside from meeting up, what else is on your mind?
2023-11-01T09:35:11, Jacob: Well, I was thinking that it might be a good time to define our relationship. What do you think about that?
2023-11-01T09:35:59, Emily: I'm glad you brought it up. I've been thinking about it too. I'd love for us to be exclusive if you're comfortable with it.
2023-11-01T09:37:07, Jacob: I am. ðŸ˜Š Exclusive it is, then!
2023-11-01T09:38:23, Emily: That's great news. This just made my day even better. ðŸ¥°
2023-11-01T09:38:43, Jacob: Mine too. I can't wait to see you and take this to the next level. Until then, let's keep this connection strong.
2023-11-01T09:39:07, Emily: Absolutely! We'll make it work. Talk to you soon! ðŸ˜˜
