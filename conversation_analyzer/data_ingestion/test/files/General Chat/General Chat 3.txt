2022-03-05 17:30, Jake Thompson: Yo! Wassup, man?
2022-03-05 17:32, Jake Thompson: Dude, have ya heard about that gnarly concert happenin' at Madison Square Garden next Friday? Metallica is gonna be there!
2022-03-05 17:36, Mike Davis: Hey Jake! Nothin' much man, just chillin'.
2022-03-05 17:38, Mike Davis: What!? No way, Metallica? That's sick!
2022-03-05 17:42, Jake Thompson: Yeah, man! Totally! Tickets are going for like, $200 a pop though. It's steep but could be pretty epic.
2022-03-05 17:45, Jake Thompson: Like, think about it. A whole night of headbanging with the legends themselves. Worth it, don't ya think?
2022-03-05 18:00, Mike Davis: Dude, that's a lot of dough. But you're right, it's freakin' Metallica! They're legends!
2022-03-05 18:05, Mike Davis: And you know what? YOLO! Let's do it. I'll fork out the cash.
2022-03-05 18:10, Jake Thompson: That's the spirit, bro! Let's get those tix tomorrow around noon?
2022-03-05 18:12, Mike Davis: Sounds like a plan, mate. We should probably think about where to meet up and all that jazz. Any ideas?
2022-03-05 18:18, Jake Thompson: Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe somewhere near the venue? I'll look up some places and let you know.
2022-03-05 18:22, Mike Davis: Sounds good, man. Let's try to find a place that isn't too crowded. Maybe some chill bar or somethin'.
2022-03-05 18:25, Jake Thompson: Yeah, definitely. A chill spot where we can grab a couple of beers before the show sounds perfect.
2022-03-05 18:30, Mike Davis: Right on. Lookin' forward to it. Let's touch base tomorrow about the tickets and the meetup spot.
2022-03-05 18:33, Jake Thompson: Absolutely, man. Talk to you tomorrow. Have a good night!
2022-03-05 18:35, Mike Davis: You too bro..
2022-03-05 18:40, Jake Thompson: Later, dude!
2022-03-06 09:45, Jake Thompson: Morning, dude! Just checking if we're still on for getting those tickets today?
2022-03-06 09:50, Mike Davis: Morning, Jake! Yeah, we're still on. I'll be free around noon, as planned.
2022-03-06 10:00, Jake Thompson: Perfect! Also, I found a pretty cool bar not too far from Madison Square Garden. It's called Jimmy's Corner. Heard of it?
2022-03-06 10:05, Mike Davis: Jimmy's Corner, huh? Can't say I have. Is it any good?
2022-03-06 10:10, Jake Thompson: Reviews say it's a classic dive bar with a killer jukebox. Could be a good spot to pre-game. What do you think?
2022-03-06 10:20, Mike Davis: Sounds like my kind of place. Let's do it!
