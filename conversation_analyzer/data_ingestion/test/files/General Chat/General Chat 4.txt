2022-03-05 15:20, Sam Johnson: Hey! How's it goin'?
2022-03-05 15:22, Sam Johnson: Listen, I've got this crazy idea. You know how we've been talking about starting our own business? Well, I've been doing some research and I think we should start a vintage vinyl record store.
2022-03-05 15:25, Sam Johnson: I mean, think about it. Vinyl is coming back in a big way. People are loving the whole vintage vibe, and there's something about the sound quality of a record that you just can't get from digital music. Plus, we both love music and have a decent collection to start off with.
2022-03-05 15:30, Sam Johnson: I found a place downtown that's going for $2000 a month. It's a bit steep, but it's in a prime location, right next to the university.
2022-03-05 15:35, Lucy Smith: Hey Sam! I'm good, thanks.
2022-03-05 15:38, Lucy Smith: Wow, you've really been thinking about this, huh?
2022-03-05 15:42, Lucy Smith: I do love the idea. You're right, vinyl is getting popular again and we both have a passion for it. But $2000 a month is a lot of money. We need to consider other costs as well, like inventory, employees, utilities, marketing...
2022-03-05 15:45, Lucy Smith: Not trying to be a downer, but we need to think this through carefully.
2022-03-05 15:50, Sam Johnson: Totally agree. We need to plan this out properly. Maybe we can meet tomorrow to discuss this further? Say, around 4 PM at the Starbucks on 5th Street?
2022-03-05 15:55, Lucy Smith: Sounds good, see you tomorrow at Starbucks. Let's make a plan!
2022-03-06 13:50, Sam Johnson: Hi Lucy! Just checking in before our meeting. Still good for 4 PM?
2022-03-06 13:52, Lucy Smith: Hey Sam! Yup, I'm still good for 4. See you at Starbucks!
2022-03-06 14:00, Sam Johnson: Great! I'll bring along some preliminary business plans I've been working on.
2022-03-06 14:10, Lucy Smith: I've been thinking about potential suppliers and I'll bring along the list.
2022-03-06 14:15, Sam Johnson: Looking forward to it!
2022-03-06 14:30, Sam Johnson: Oh, and Lucy, I've been thinking... if we're serious about this, we should probably get legal advice. Know any good lawyers who won't charge us an arm and a leg?
2022-03-06 14:35, Lucy Smith: Actually, I do. My cousin, Jess, is a lawyer. She specializes in business law. I'm sure she'd be willing to give us some advice.
2022-03-06 14:40, Sam Johnson: That's awesome, Lucy! Could you ask her if she's free to meet with us sometime next week?
2022-03-06 14:45, Lucy Smith: Sure thing. I'll get in touch with her and let you know.
2022-03-06 14:50, Sam Johnson: Thanks
