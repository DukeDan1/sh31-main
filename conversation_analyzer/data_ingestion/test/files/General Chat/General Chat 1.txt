2022-10-08T10:38:02, Chris Blonde: Hey Martin! How you doing?? Long time no speak! 
2022-10-08T10:42:58, Martin Fisher: Hey Chris! Its been a minute. How are things in Philly?
2022-10-08T10:45:23, Chris Blonde: Same old same old, you know what Ma is like... doesn't make living easy. Trying my best to fit in here, but I am missing you folks from Chattanooga 
2022-10-08T10:49:40, Martin Fisher: No place quite like Philly eh but that sucks you guys don't get on better, especially now you've so far from everyone. Hope you get that sorted out
2022-10-08T10:49:17, Martin Fisher: Anyway what can I do ya for?
2022-10-08T10:52:45, Chris Blonde: was wondering if you had any cool book recommendations? Been trying to get back into it but can't seem to get past the first chapter of anything im picking it up! And i know you love your books 
2022-10-08T11:01:00, Martin Fisher: Now we're talking! Dune is my top recommendation right now for sure. Such an easy one to get engrossed in, even if some of the references are a bit too on the nose now 
2022-10-08T11:02:05, Martin Fisher: If you don't fancy that the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is a great one too! Know you love your space stuff 
2022-10-08T11:05:33, Chris Blonde: Dune? Isn't that the one with the Silly Space Worms? And swear i have heard good things about hitchhikers guide to the galaxy too. Had a google and the top review is really positive from someone called 'Egg'. They seem trustworthy 
2022-10-08T11:12:12, Martin Fisher: yeah and that's only the start of it lmao. Gets even weirder when they start talking about spice and the Jihad (not spoiling too much with that don't worry). Its very much of its time, but that doesn't stop it from being totally unique!
2022-10-08T11:13:50, Martin Fisher: Gotta love the egg... Seems like someone with great taste. I'd maybe go with hitchhikers guide to the galaxy then if that one is speaking too you more. Plus its shorter so more chance of finishing it hehe
2022-10-08T11:15:48, Martin Fisher: You gonna be back in my area anytime soon? We need a good catch up!
2022-10-08T11:23:29, Chris Blonde: probably not for a while /: this new job makes it tough to take time off easily. Plus I hate the travel
2022-10-08T11:29:51, Martin Fisher: Damn. Well be sure to hit me up next time you're in town! Or you need more book recommendations 
2022-10-08T11:31:57, Chris Blonde: will do bro! You gotta come round to Philly some time too, We can run it back on the court like we used to? You still playing ball often ?
2022-10-08T11:39:09, Martin Fisher: I'd love to come to Philly, especially if we could see a Sixers game. Got high hopes for them next season... Still playing a bit of ball but not as often. Would be so down to get some games in next time we meet 
2022-10-08T11:40:25, Chris Blonde: Perfect! Sounds good. Nice to hear from you! 
2022-10-08T11:41:39, Martin Fisher: Likewise dude! Stay safe
