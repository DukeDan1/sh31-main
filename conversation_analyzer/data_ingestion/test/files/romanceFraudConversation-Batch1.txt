2021-09-25T15:30:01, Jamie Smith: Yo, fellas, has anyone heard from Erin today? 🤔 Was supposed to meet her at the library today but she didn't show
2021-09-25T15:32:15, Alex Martinez: Nah bro, haven't heard from her since yesterday. She said something 'bout going to that new exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Maybe she got caught up there? 🎨
2021-09-25T15:34:50, Mia Williams: Guuuys, I'm getting worried now 😟 We should've heard from her by now. She ain't the type to just vanish like this.
2021-09-25T15:36:30, Jamie Smith: True that, Mia. Let's not freak out though. Lemme try calling her again
2021-09-25T15:38:10, Alex Martinez: While you're at it, Jamie, someone should reach out to her folks too. They might know something
2021-09-25T15:40:20, Mia Williams: Good call, Alex. I'll hit up Mrs. Johnson. She's always been chill with us. 📲
2021-09-25T15:43:45, Jamie Smith: Still no answer guys. Her phone is going straight to voicemail. 😓
2021-09-25T15:46:00, Alex Martinez: Yo, what if she's in some kinda trouble? Like, should we call the cops or sumthin'? 
2021-09-25T15:47:30, Mia Williams: Hold up, Alex. Just talked to Erin's mom. She said Erin mentioned something about going to a book signing at Barnes & Noble this afternoon. 📖 Might be J.K. Rowling's new book or something.
2021-09-25T15:50:00, Jamie Smith: Ahh, that makes sense. Erin's a huge Harry Potter fan. ⚡️ Let's chill for a bit. Maybe she's just lost track of time, y'know how she gets around books.
2021-09-25T16:10:20, Mia Williams: Guys, I just talked to the staff at Barnes & Noble. They said the book signing ended an hour ago and Erin wasn't there. 😱
2021-09-25T16:12:35, Jamie Smith: Wait, what?! 😟 But if she wasn't at the museum or the book signing, where could she be?
2021-09-25T16:14:00, Alex Martinez: This ain't good, y'all. 😓 We gotta do something. Maybe we should really call the cops now.
2021-09-25T16:16:45, Mia Williams: Yeah, I think we should. Erin wouldn't just disappear without telling anyone. 😭
2021-09-25T16:19:30, Jamie Smith: Alright, I'm gonna call the police. In the meantime, let's keep trying to reach her and check around if anyone has seen her.
2021-09-25T16:22:10, Alex Martinez: I'll head over to the museum again. Maybe someone there saw her
2021-09-25T16:24:20, Mia Williams: And I'll ask around the neighborhood. Let's hope we find her soon
2021-09-25T16:27:00, Jamie Smith: Just got off the phone with the police. They're gonna start a search…
2021-09-25T16:35:10, Mia Williams: Guys... I have to tell you something... I didn't want to scare you before... but I think Erin might have been in some kind of trouble... 😥
2021-09-25T16:37:15, Jamie Smith: What?!  Mia, you gotta spill it now, you can't drop a bomb like that and not explain.
2021-09-25T16:39:40, Alex Martinez: Yeah, Mia! What the heck? We're freaking out here! 😡
2021-09-25T16:41:00, Mia Williams: Alright, alright! 😓 So, yesterday Erin was telling me about this guy she met online. She said she was going to meet him today...
2021-09-25T16:43:30, Jamie Smith: Wait, what? Erin was meeting a stranger? And you didn't think to tell us this before? 
2021-09-25T16:45:20, Alex Martinez: Dude, that's not cool. She could be in real danger. We gotta tell the cops this ASAP!
2021-09-25T16:48:00, Mia Williams: I know, I know! I messed up. I didn't think it would come to this. I'm gonna call the police and tell them about this guy
